# Direct-Methods-for-Matrix-Inversion
Comparison of Adjoint method, Gaussian elimination, LU Decomposition and Tri Diagonal matrix algoritm (Thomas algo)

The solvers all solve the equation A x = b

The Matrix generator code takes in number of rows of the square matrix as an input. It is to given as a command line argument. If required, the matrix of interest (A) can be provided as a text file named "inputMatrix.txt" in a rowise format. At the end of the file, the vector (b) should also be provided (perhaps in a new line).

The code "LinAlSolnAlgoTime.py" plots the time complexity of each of these algorithms.
